# 🚜 Predicting the Sale Price of Bulldozers - Machine Learning Project

## 📋 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the sale price of bulldozers using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that can accurately estimate future auction prices based on bulldozer characteristics and historical sales data.

## 🎯 Problem Definition
**How well can we predict the future sale price of a bulldozer, given its characteristics and previous examples of how much similar bulldozers have been sold for?**

## 📊 Data Source
The data is sourced from the Kaggle Blue Book for Bulldozers competition:
- **Train.csv**: Training set containing data through the end of 2011
- **Valid.csv**: Validation set with data from January 1, 2012 - April 30, 2012
- **Test.csv**: Test set with data from May 1, 2012 - November 2012 (released in final competition week)

## 📈 Evaluation Metric
The competition uses **RMSLE** (Root Mean Squared Log Error) between the actual and predicted auction prices as the evaluation metric.

**Goal**: Build a machine learning model that minimizes RMSLE.

## 🔍 Features
A comprehensive data dictionary detailing all features of the dataset is available on Google Sheets:

## 🛠️ Technical Approach
The project will follow a standard machine learning workflow:
1. Data exploration and analysis
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Feature engineering
4. Model selection and training
5. Hyperparameter tuning
6. Model evaluation
7. Prediction generation
